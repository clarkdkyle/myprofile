            <p id="about">
              Throughout my professional career the majority of my time was used
              engaging with nerds and do nerd things. I love video games, comic
              books, board games, and movies. I spent most of my
              roaring twenties running an all in one nerd hobby shop called Game
              Nut Entertainment, that specialized in movies, video games, board
              games, card games, and comic books. What I love most about being a nerd is engaging with people and seeing how excited they get about their favorite topics. 
              One of the most frustrating things about being a person is never having enough time for you personal interests.
              My goal is to organize my intersts for me and give you an idea of the things that interest me.
              
              <br> <br /> 
              With this page I aim to organize the games I want to play next. As you'll see I have too many games I want to play and not enough time. 
              I aim to keep a list of games I want to play next. I decided to expand this page to include books and comic books that I want to read. In the future
              I plan to add a page for tv shows, anime and movies as well.
