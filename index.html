              Throughout my professional career the majority of my time was used
              engaging with nerds do nerd things. I love video games, comic
              books, board games, and movies. Along with being a normal nerd,
              I'm also a cow-nerd; I enjoy taking care of my family cattle and
              horses. I am still very much a nerd whether it's herding cattle
              and putting out hay or playing video games. I realized how much I
              enjoyed these things when I would get off work to either play
              games like Stardew Valley to take care of my digital farm animals,
              or go outside and take care of the real ones. I spent most of my
              roaring twenties running an all in one nerd hobby shop called Game
              Nut Entertainment, that specialized in movies, video games, board
              games, card games, and comic books. One of the things I heard most
              while running the store was how unique it was and how many people
              wished they had a similar company where they are from. What I want
              most out of this career is to help make collectible nerd culture
              an easier thing for other geeks as consumers to be a part of and
              enage with eachother. It was often surprsing and frustrating how
              difficult it was to find websites and applications that would
              properly organize/catagorize comic books or movie inventories with
              pricing and the ability to trade in or resell. That is a gap I
              hope to learn how to fill.
